Hello!

So this is a simple OpenGL ES 2.0 Application I made for android!

Hopefully it helps guide someone who is newer-ish at OpenGL ES 2.0 get started with it? (Maybe this will serve as a guide of what NOT to do?)

I want to add support for loading models, but I am conflicted if I should also do texturing with that or not. And also whether or not I should use my own format (JSON-based) or some other 3d model format like OBJ or something

SO YEAH
